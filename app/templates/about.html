	  <p style="color:brown;text-align: center;">How might we predict the percentage of food imports of a certain country by considering the country’s population, rainfall, number of natural disasters occurrences per annum, arable land and its political stability index? </p>
  
	  <h1 style="color:coral;text-align: center;">How Does It Work?</h1>
	  
	  <p style="color:brown;text-align: center;"> Our model aims to tackle the issue of food security through Food Import estimates. By taking various factors into consideration, this cutting-edge machine learning model will help you predict the approximate Food Import value a specific country should adopt, given its current situation. The programme has been trained on large quantities of data all around the world for a better and more robust model. All you need to do is to input the relevant details of a country and the model will generate the result for you! </p>

	  <p style="color:brown;text-align: center;"> All the factors considered were decided by thoroughly researching which variables impact food imports most.
	  
	  Food imports of a country is largely dependent on demand and supply factors of food resources. Population size of a country is a good indication of potential demand for food resources. Climate Risk Index, Arable Land and Local Agriculture Production are factors of food production or factors that affect supply. </p> 


    <div id="population">
    <h1 style="color:coral;text-align: center;">1.Population</h1>
	  
	  <p style="color:brown;text-align: center;">Total population is based on the de facto definition of population, which counts all residents regardless of legal status or citizenship. The values shown are midyear estimates.</p>
	  
	  
	  
	<div id="valueaddedbylocagri"> 
    <h1 style="color:coral;text-align: center;">2.Value Added By Local Agriculture</h1>
	  
	  <p style="color:brown;text-align: center;">Value added from agricultural sector allows us to visualize the proportion of local food production in the entirety of national economy, and its correlation to the subsequent volume of food imports</p>
	  
	  
	  
	<div id="cri">  
    <h1 style="color:coral;text-align: center;">3.Climate Risk Index</h1>
	  
	  <p style="color:brown;text-align: center;">The Global Climate Risk Index identifies the extent to which countries have been affected by extreme weather events. These can be meteorological events such as tropical storms or tornados, hydrological events such as storm surges or flash floods, or climatological events such as wildfires or droughts
</p>
	  
	  
	  
	<div id="arableland">  
    <h1 style="color:coral;text-align: center;">4.Arable Land</h1>
	  
	  <p style="color:brown;text-align: center;">Arable land includes land defined by the FAO as land under temporary crops (double-cropped areas are counted once), temporary meadows for mowing or for pasture, land under market or kitchen gardens, and land temporarily fallow. Land abandoned as a result of shifting cultivation is excluded.</p>
	  
	  
	  
	  
    
        <div id="locagriprod">
        <h1 style="color:coral;text-align: center;">5.Local Agriculture Production</h1>
<p style="color:brown;text-align: center;">Crop and livestock statistics are recorded for 278 products, covering the following categories:</p>
    <ul style="color:brown;text-align: center;">1)CROPS PRIMARY: involving Cereals, Citrus Fruit, Fibre Crops, Fruit, Oil Crops, Oil Crops and Cakes in Oil Equivalent, Pulses, Roots and Tubers, Sugar Crops, Treenuts and Vegetables.</ul>
    <ul style="color:brown;text-align: center;">2) CROPS PROCESSED: Beer of barley; Cotton lint; Cottonseed; Margarine, short; Molasses; Oil, coconut (copra); Oil, cottonseed; Oil, groundnut; Oil, linseed; Oil, maize; Oil, olive, virgin, Sugar Raw Centrifugal, Wine etc.</ul>
    <ul style="color:brown;text-align: center;">3) LIVE ANIMALS: Beehives; Buffaloes; Camelids, other; Camels; Cattle; Chickens; Ducks; Geese and guinea fowls; Goats; Horses; Mules; Pigeons, other birds.</ul>
    <ul style="color:brown;text-align: center;">4) LIVESTOCK PRIMARY: Beeswax; Eggs (various types); Hides buffalo, fresh; Hides, cattle, fresh; Honey, natural; Meat.</ul>
    <ul style="color:brown;text-align: center;">5) LIVESTOCK PROCESSED: Butter (of milk from sheep, goat, buffalo, cow); Cheese (of milk from goat, buffalo, sheep, cow milk); Cheese of skimmed cow milk; Cream fresh; Ghee (cow and buffalo milk); Lard; Milk (dry buttermilk, skimmed condensed.</ul>

<div id="politicalstability">
<h1 style="color:coral;text-align: center;">6.Political Stability Index</h1>
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  <p style="color:brown;text-align: center;">Political stability index has many sub variables such as riots, voting propaganda etc. Political stability fundamentally accounts for a country’s state of turmoil and its effect on the ability of a country to import food amidst its crisis.
